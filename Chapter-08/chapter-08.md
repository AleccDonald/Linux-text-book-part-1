__Chapter 8 Objectives__

This portion of the book begins Part II. The first 7 chapters focused more on the *philosophy* and basic tenants of how Unix and Linux were created. The remaining 8 chapters now will focus on the application of what we have learned and focus  on the using the opensource technology of Linux.  The Objectes of this chapter are as follows:

   * Understand how to write and use basic shell scripts
   * if statements
   * for loops
   * System environment variables
   * Passing Variables into scripts
   * Scheduling Shell Scripts With Cron Tab

__Outcomes__

  At the conclusion of this chapter you will have furthered your understanding of the vi editor and be able to demonstrate how to use control structures in shell scripts.  You will also learn about command line variables and how they extend the ability of a shell script to accpet dynamic input.  You will be able to schedule a shell script to run at a scheduled time by using cron service increasing your ability to reduce work by automating repetative tasks.

## Basic Shell Scripts Part II
 
   In the previous chapter we were introduced to the simplist of shell scripts.  In this chapter we are going to increase the depth of our knowledge.

   Add some samples here
   
   Segway to control structures
 
### Bash Shell Control Structures 

   Just like any programming language we cannot have complex logic if we don't have control structures.  The two basic ones we want to cover are if statements and for loops.  There are the other traditional control structures but are used less commonly because of the nature of a shell script is a single execution not as a repeated process or system service.
   
### Structures
 
   Variables - explain the scope
   Arrays in bash +4.0 (macs even 10.11 have 3.2 by default. (Add link to fix it)
   Commandline variables $1 $2...  $# ands $@   
   
### if statements

  Get chart from tldp for options
  
  note about structure of spaces and how if handle numeric comparisons.  

### for loops

  used to loop through contents - files, arrays
   using $@ and $# for length variables and sentinels.
