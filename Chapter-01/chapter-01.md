# Introduction

[*I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones... - Linus Torvalds 1991*](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/comp.os.minix/dlNtH7RRrGA/SwRavCzVE7gJ "Initial Post About Linux.")

## Objectives of this book

  As you know there are many many books on Linux out there.  This book strives to be different in trying to highlight the philosophy of Linux/Unix and tying that to the tools and nature of the tools in Linux.    Understanding the history of Linux goes along way to understanding how it works.  This book strives to be different as well.  In addition to being pegged to the LPIC-I/Linux+ content it will go beyond being just a training book.  
  
  For instructors - we are going beyond the traditional powerpoint world, and looking into using new technologies like Microsoft Sway for presentations.  Also including audio and video excerpts as well as working code examples using [doitlive](http://doitlive.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ "tool for demoing code") for demonstration purposes.  The book is being publsihed on Github under a Create Commons CC-SA Share alike license -- this way as things change code can be updated or removed and new digital versions can be published quickly.  

## Presenatation Style

 This book doubles as a universtiy text book.  It has a 16 week semester structure, along with review questions, podcast assignements, and lab exerciese.  But the book can be used beyond that.  There is a wealth of other material that is can be covered in depth depending on your needs.

## Background 

   What gives you the right to write this book?   There are many things I still have to learn and I find that I am always learning something new or tying an insight of two unrelated points together.  Having done system administration full time since 2005 and teaching and researching full time since 2010 I have gained on the job experience that I believe can be useful to those aspiring to use this book.
