# Introduction to the Technology and Philosophy of Linux Part I

![*One of the survivors, poking around in the ruins with the point of a spear, uncovers a singed photo of Richard Stallman. They stare in silence. "This," one of them finally says, "This is a man who BELIEVED in something."*](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/operating_systems.png "Operating Systems")

[*"I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones..." Linus Torvalds 1991*](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!msg/comp.os.minix/dlNtH7RRrGA/SwRavCzVE7gJ "Initial Post About Linux.")

## Objectives of this book

  As you know there are many many books on Linux out there.  This book strives to be different in trying to highlight two areas.  First the philosophy of Linux and its design.  Anyone can teach you how to push a button, but this book aims to go beyond that and help you understand the reason the button is there in the first place.  Above all Linux is merely a tool to help you get your work done.  Seeing as this book is self-published its exercises and sections can be updated rapidly to cover the ever-changing tools in Linux. I have found over the years understanding the history of Linux goes along way to understanding how it works.  This book strives to be different as well.  In addition to being pegged to the LPIC-I/Linux+ content it will go beyond being just a training book.  
  
  For instructors - we are going beyond the traditional Powerpoint world, and looking into using new technologies like Microsoft Sway for presentations. The book is being publsihed on Github under a Creative Commons CC-SA Share alike license -- this way as things change code can be updated or removed and new digital versions can be published quickly.  

  Some of these chapters are heavier in content then others.  Some are lighter.  Feel free to combine and remix the chapters.  You are even welcome to fork the proejct on Github and remix it or contribute back patches and pull requests.

## Presenatation Style

 This book doubles as a universtiy text book.  It has a 16 week semester structure, along with review questions, podcast assignements, and lab exerciese.  But the book can be used beyond that.  There is a wealth of other material that is can be covered in depth depending on your needs.

 Will get to that once the content is done...
