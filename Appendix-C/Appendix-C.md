Post your topics on the Blackboard Class Discussion board under the Chapter-02 Case Studies forum - both of your case study choices have to be unique from everyone else. Those who choose first will get the ones they want. There are over 200+ case studies there will be plenty of options.

You can find them at [https://highscalability.com/blog/category/example](http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example "Case Study Examples")  or look on the High Scalability website on the lower right hand side for the "All Time Favorites" header to find some of the more popular services.
