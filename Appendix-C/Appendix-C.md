Watch this movie and answer the questions below or via the online assignment provided for you by the instructor.

1. Based on the movie's tone and rhetoric - why do you think there was an anti-Microsoft tone at the time of the movies making (~2001)? (You may need to research [Microsoft anti-trust case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp. "Anti-Trust") ).

### Lab

Most of the popular and functional pieces of software you use everyday invovle Free and OpenSource. Choose 2 case studies from [https://highscalability.com](https://highscalability.com "High Scalability") and write a review of the company's architecture based on these issues:  

Post your topics on the Blackboard Class Discussion board under the Chapter-02 Case Studies forum - both of your case study choices have to be unique from everyone else. Those who choose first will get the ones they want. There are over 200+ case studies there will be plenty of options.

You can find them at [https://highscalability.com/blog/category/example](http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example "Case Study Examples")  or look on the High Scalability website on the lower right hand side for the "All Time Favorites" header to find some of the more popular services.   Its best to find a company that you use or support.

Answer these questions (not all of the Answers are in each case study!)

1. What market does that company serve? (What do they do?) And have they always served that market?
1. What Operating System(s) are used?
1. What programming languages/frameworks are used?
1. What storage and what database technologies are used?

### Lab

The objectives of this lab is to use the shell commands we learned in this chapter and understand their proper usage patterns. The outcome will be that you will be able to successfully use the Linux Shell for navigation, file creation, and file modification. Resist the temptation to use the GUI file manager and a web browser.  All actions will be done through the shell unless noted.  All work can be done on either Ubuntu 18.04 desktop or Fedora 28 desktop unless noted. 

Preface all screenshots with an H3 header indicated the question number: for example, Question 01, Question 02, and so forth.

1) Login to your Linux System. Using a package manager install the ```git``` program.  
    i) issue the command ```git --version``` and take a screenshot of the output
1) Navigate to your home directory and then to your Documents directory.  Issue the command ```git clone https://github.com/jhajek/Linux-text-book-part-1.git```  (If you have done this command previously no need to redo it).
    i) Take a screenshot of the output of the ```ls``` command.  
1) Issue the ```cd``` command to change directory into Linux-text-book-part-1.  Issue the command to display what type of file ```.git``` is.  Repeat the process for the file named ```./title/metadata.yaml```   
    i) Take a screen shot of the output of the previous commands.
1) Use the ```wget``` command to retreive a copy of the Packer.io binary for Linux.  Use this URL as the argument for ```wget```:[https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.3.0/packer_1.3.0_linux_amd64.zip](https://releases.hashicorp.com/packer/1.3.0/packer_1.3.0_linux_amd64.zip "Packer") 
    i) Take a screenshot of the ```ls``` command after you have executed the previous command.
1) Use the ```unzip``` command to unzip the binary and extract the file directly to the location ```/usr/local/bin```.  **Hint:** use the ```man unzip``` command to find out the usage option in order to accomplish this.
    i) To show this was succesful take a screenshot of the output of the command ```packer -v```.
1) Use the ```wget``` command to retrieve an archived copy of the Hadoop binaries from the web.  You can use this address as an argument to your wget command: [http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.7.5/hadoop-2.7.5.tar.gz](http://archive.apache.org/dist/hadoop/common/hadoop-2.7.5/hadoop-2.7.5.tar.gz "Hadoop URL")
    i) Take a screenshot of the ```ls``` command after you have executed the previous command.
1) Use the ```tar -xvzf``` command to extract the files, we will cover ```tar``` in later chapter.  ```tar``` is the commmand ```-xvzf``` is the options and you need to provide the argument of the hadoop*.tar.gz 
        i) Take a screenshot of the output of the ```ls``` command to show the extracted hadoop directory.  
1) Find the command that is used to rename a file or directory and rename the Hadoop directory to be ust hadoop
    i) Take a screenshot of the output of the ```ls``` command.    
1) What would be the command to delete the file hadoop*.zip?
    i) Issue the command ```ls```, then type the command to remove the .tar.gz file, the type the ```ls``` command again to show it has been remove.  Take a screenshot of the combined output of all 3 directories.   
1) Using a Web Browser from your GUI, navigate to and open the file named ```chapter-05-file-path-exercise.html``` located under the directory ```./Linux-text-book-part-1-master/files/Chapter-05/images/```:  Note that the images on the web page are broken.   Take a look at the source code (view source) and move the **stallman.jpg**  to the proper directory to make the webpage render that image properly in a single command using the command line.  
    i) Take a screenshot of that single command and a screenshot of the web browser showing the **stallman.jpg** image properly rendering.
1) Using the commandline again, move the **ms-loves-linux.png** image to the proper directory using the ```mv``` command in a single command:
    i) Take a screenshot of that single command and a screenshot of the output of the web browser showing both the **stallman.jpg** and the **ms-loves-linux.png** images properly rendering. 
1) Assume your PWD is your Home directory: In a series of commands, ```cd``` to Documents, then create a directory named ```packer-scripts```.  Under this directory create 5 sub-directories, ```ubuntu16-04```, ```ubuntu18-04```, ```fedora28```, ```centos7```, ```OmniOS```.  
    i) With your PWD as ```~/Documents/packer-scripts```, execute the command that will give a long listing of the contents of the directory.  Take a screenshot of this command as well as the output.

### Lab

The objectives of this lab will be to use the shell and understand meta-characters, pipes, search, and tools. The outcome will be that you will be able to successfully use meta-characters for file creation, location, modification, and manipulation.  You will successfully master the concept of pipes and redirection as well.  Resist the temptation to use the GUI file manager and a web browser.  All actions will be done through the shell.

1. Your PWD is ~. Make a new directory called ```text```.  In that directory Use the ```wget``` command to retreive a compressed file (zip) of the class textbook from: [https://github.com/jhajek/Linux-text-book-part-1/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/jhajek/Linux-text-book-part-1/archive/master.zip) and extract it.
