# Linux-text-book-part-1
This is the outline and of intermediate content for Linux Technology and Philosophy based on LPIC II


How to install;

1.  You can just open the markdown (.md) in Visual Studio Code Editor (great free editor with Markdown preview support built in and it is cross platform Windows, Mac and Linux!) [Here is the link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2.  Use Pandoc to build your output (This README assumes you are using Linux, but these instructions can be adapted to build on Mac and Windows since pandoc has multiple distributions

[Install Instructions](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)

> Ubuntu Linux
> I would recommend installing Pandoc directly from the lastest debian package.  Located here: [https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/1.15.0.6](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/1.15.0.6)
> For PDF output, youâ€™ll need LaTeX. We recommend installing TeX Live via your package manager. (On Debian/Ubuntu, ```apt-get install texlive```.)

> Red Hat Linux 
> See yum or dnf

> Mac OSX
> [http://pandoc.org/installing.html](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)

> Windows 
You need Pandoc 1.15.x  and MikTex 2.9.x to build this book proper

[Pandoc Windows pandoc-1.15.0.6.msi](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/1.15.0.6 "Pandoc MSI")

[MikTex](http://miktex.org/download "Miktex Download")

In order to enable script execution for Powershell - run this command from an Administrator enabled Powershell console:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned```

You can then run the build script ./build-windows.ps1 from the powershell window and this will generate the digital output

On your first build you will recieve a Package Installtion dialogue from MikTex asking you to install additional packages so as to be able to generate PDFs.
