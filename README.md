# Linux-text-book-part-1
This is the outline and of intermediate content for Linux Technology and Philosophy based on LPIC II


How to install;

1.  You can just open the markdown (.md) in Visual Studio Code Editor (great free editor with Markdown preview support built in and it is cross platform Windows, Mac and Linux!) [Here is the link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2.  Use Pandoc to build your output (This README assumes you are using Linux, but these instructions can be adapted to build on Mac and Windows since pandoc has multiple distributions

[Install Instructions](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)

## Ubuntu Linux
 
I would recommend installing Pandoc directly from the lastest debian package.  Located here: [https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.19.1/pandoc-1.19.1-1-amd64.deb](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.19.1/pandoc-1.19.1-1-amd64.deb). For PDF output, youâ€™ll need LaTeX. We recommend installing TeX Live via your package manager. (On Debian/Ubuntu, ```apt-get install texlive```.)

### Linux dependencies
* texlive
* texlive-latex-recommended
* texlive-latex-extra
* texlive-fonts-recommended

## Mac OSX
  * [http://pandoc.org/installing.html](http://pandoc.org/installing.html)

## Windows 
You need Pandoc 1.15.x  and MikTex 2.9.x to build this book proper

[Pandoc Windows pandoc-1.19.1  msi](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/1.19.1/pandoc-1.19.1-windows.msi "Pandoc MSI")

[MikTex](http://miktex.org/download "Miktex Download")

In order to enable script execution for Powershell - run this command from an Administrator enabled Powershell console:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

You can then run the build script ./build-windows.ps1 from the powershell window and this will generate the digital output

On your first build you will recieve a Package Installtion dialogue from MikTex asking you to install additional packages so as to be able to generate PDFs.

__Kindle .mobi__

To generate .mobi files for use on Kindle devices or apps, you need to install Kindlegen from [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211)

__Reading PDF and ePUB__

You can use any PDF reader, Adobe or the Microsfot Reader built into Windows 8 and 10.

Or you can use the [FireFox ePub Reader plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/epubreader/ "Plugin to read ePub in FireFox") that lets you read directly from the browser.

ePub and PDF can alsop be read via the Barns and Noble Nook app.  It is available for all platforms, [iOS, Androis, and Windows](http://www.nook.com/nookapp/#appChoices "Nook app").  I use it and can recommend it on any platform.

the iBooks app on iOS works as well for viewing ePubs and PDFs.
