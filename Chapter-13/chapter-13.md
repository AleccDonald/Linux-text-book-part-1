![*Good thing we avoided that one...*](images/Chapter-Header/Chapter-13/2038-2.png "2038")

## Objectives

  Learn about:
  * Hashicorp Tech
    + Vagrant
    + Packer.io
    + Consul
    + Vault
  * Chef 
  * Ansible
  * Puppet
  * cfEngine

## Outcomes

At the conlcusion of this chapter you will have a basic understanding of how to use infrastructure automation and orchestration tools.  You will be familiar and able to explain the concept of immutable infrastructure and will be able to explain cloud native development technologies as well as OS container technology.

### Automation

One of the main things that computers are good at is executing repetive tasks.  One of the things humans seem to dislike is repeating the same task.  So how to solve this when it comes to computers, where there are only a small number of tasks that are repeated over and over.  One of the problems that has been common is the divide between the developers (devs) and the operations (ops) people.  Developers need hardware to test their code on and then more hardware to run their code in production.  Operations people have to maintain those systems and the code and the lifecycle of the application.  Developers started to think, could we deploy our infrastructure in the same way we deploy code?  Could we automate the way out of this problem?  A young developer named Mitchel Hashimoto had the same problem.
