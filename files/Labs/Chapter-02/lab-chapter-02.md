## Activity 1

Most of the popular and functional pieces of software you use everyday involve Free and OpenSource. Choose 2 case studies from [https://highscalability.com](https://highscalability.com "High Scalability") and write a review of the company's architecture based the listed items.

You can find them at [https://highscalability.com/blog/category/example](http://highscalability.com/blog/category/example "Case Study Examples")  or look on the High Scalability website on the lower right hand side for the "All Time Favorites" header to find some of the more popular services.

Answer these questions with a few short sentences:  

* What is Bryan Cantrill's initial main point in the first article?

Bryan Cantrill's initial main point of the first article is, like  midlife crisis within a person, an open source midlife questioning will survive as well by returning to its original values and purpose of being free rather than being restricted.
* Do you agree with him, why or why not?

I do agree with him becasuse open source is not going away anytime soon and in todays day and age open source is used widely and heavily used. If companies try to license their way in open source but claim that open source isn't restricting would be false. Their agreements make software avaiable to download but on terms that they made which doesn't allow the the use of other software because of compeition.
* What is Jay Kreps response/contention in the second article?

Jay Kreps response overall was him disagreeing with Cantrill's mains points and using factual evidence to back up his side and prove that Clunent's license change is not bad. He states that his book analogys are not accurate, they are trying their best to be honest, and their overall main goal is to give away software in as liberal a way as they can sustain. However Kreps did agree on some points, like agreeing that is was silly to comment on good or bad issues about the behavior of the cloud providers and he understands that companies habe a responsibility to their open source ecosystems beyond their profit motif
* Do you agree with him, why or why not?
I do agree with him partialy because of the  evidence provided about the confluent license companies and it sounds like their main goal is to help communities in a ethical and responsible way, but overall I do not agree with him. License agreements overall restrict users from using other open source softwares that will help them with certain projects that will take of way from that companies profit.
* What is the main point of Bryan Cantrill's rejoinder in the third article?

Bryan Cantrill's main point is that the software that customers buy isn't really theirs to own. It is merely a copy you can modify and use but you do not actually own it.
* Do you agree with him, why or why not?

I do agree with Cantrill becuase why buy a software for open source if it is not truly going to be owned by the individual who bought it. The whole purpose of open source software is defeated if they can not freely modify their own work.
* What is Adam Jacob's opinion on running a company with an opensource product?

Adam Jacob's agrees that by keeping 100% of the software open source, the community benfits by being able to collabroate freely upstream.
* What is the solution in your opinion?

In my opinion I agree with Jacob's to keep 100% of the software open source, and not productin any proprietary features.
