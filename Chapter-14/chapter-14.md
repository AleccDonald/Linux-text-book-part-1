## Automating the Install Answer Process With Preseed and Kickstart  

  All the previous steps took maybe 10 to 15 minutes if you are on a fast machine; which is not bad at all.  But let us say you will be creating multiple virtual machines for research purposes. Or perhaps you will be recreating the same virtual machine many times.  There is a way to automate the install process.  This is called an *answer file* in the Windows world.  For Red Hat based systems this is called *kickstart* and Debian and Ubuntu use a file format called *preseed*.  None of these formats are compatible with each other but there has been some work to get limited kickstart support for Ubuntu.  

  [Debian/Ubuntu pressed template](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/amd64/apb.html "Preseed")

  [Kickstart documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/Fedora/18/html/Installation_Guide/s1-kickstart2-file.html) - it can be generated from scratch or upon a successful install a default kickstart is located in /root/anaconda-ks.cfg
